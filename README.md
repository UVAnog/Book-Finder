# Front to Back Project

This was a really fun project to undertake. I first began creating a backend using Express to write a simple web server that returns data related to a callerâ€™s url request. I used the Google Books API ( https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using ) to return the author of a book searched by the title. 

On the frontend, I used React and Material-UI to create an interface to accept a user's search of a book title, and return the author as well as links to search for the book online.
